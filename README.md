# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Features
System contains:
	- Trays/bins
	- Drawers

- Zero supports required
- Highly modular
- Components are horizontally and vertically stackable
- Many size and height variants (inter-compatible)
- Many pattern variants
- You can adjust parameters/add your own patterns and recompile (python required)
	- Feel free to use pull requests

## License
- Free for non-commercial use
- If you intend to use the designs commercially, please contact me to negotiate a commission

## Customizing

### Creating custom patterns
- SVG file format
- Use rectangles with ZERO WIDTH (give them some outline for visualisation)
- Always put four rectangles around the pattern (determining position of outer walls)

## To-do
- Explicit size combinations list (both tray and drawer)
- Lids
- Rotated pattern variants
- Side frames (vertically stackable)
  - Corner side frames - not necessary (you can just use two separate frames)
  - Double-sisded frames
  - Single-sided frames
- Articulating side frames (so you can open up the organizer)
